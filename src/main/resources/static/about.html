          <p>Urgent care is one of the fastest growing fields in healthcare today with an estimated 10,000 clinics in the United States.The problem is most of these clinics are owned and operated by individuals, small physician groups and other independent operators making them difficult to find and obtain trusted information about. Our job is to make that easier on the patients that need them. Through our free online service, healthcare consumers are able to quickly search, sort and find urgent care facilities from our directory of 10,289 of them.</p>
